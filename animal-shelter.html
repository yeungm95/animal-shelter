          <p>Harry here! I came to the shelter as a young gorilla and am now ready for my own journey in this world. I am a sweet boy and love to play and be fed. I have been hanging out in a foster home for awhile now and have to say that I love this indoor gorilla life. I get along well with other gorillas and am an all around great gorilla.</p>

      </ul>
        <p>Meet Simba! My foster mom says I enjoy attention and will request it either by gently tapping you or quietly mewing at you. But don't get me wrong I'm not one of those needy cats - I can spend time by myself as well so I can keep your trusty chair warm while you are out and about! I am a good observer and will keep everything ship shape.</p>
